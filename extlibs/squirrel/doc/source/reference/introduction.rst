Squirrel is a high level imperative-OO programming language, designed to be a powerful
scripting tool that fits in the size, memory bandwidth, and real-time requirements of
applications like games.
Although Squirrel offers a wide range of features like dynamic typing, delegation, higher
order functions, generators, tail recursion, exception handling, automatic memory
management, both compiler and virtual machine fit together in about 6k lines of C++
code.
